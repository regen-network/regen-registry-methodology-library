# Methodology for GHG & Co-Benefits in Grazing Systems

The Methodology for GHG and Co-Benefits in Grazing Systems provides a holistic assessment of ecological state indicators for grasslands under regenerative grazing practices. Managed grazing, which involves carefully controlling livestock density and intensity of grazing, has been shown to provide a wide range of ecosystem benefits such as enhanced carbon sequestration, improved soil health, and increased water infiltration.

This methodology combines remote sensing data with in-field measurements to provide high quality estimates of soil organic carbon stock and measures additional ecological co-benefits such as animal welfare, ecosystem health, and soil health.

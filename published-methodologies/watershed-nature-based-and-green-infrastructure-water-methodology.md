# Watershed Nature-Based and Green Infrastructure Water Methodology

Overview

**Methodology**: _Watershed Nature-Based and Green Infrastructure Activities Avoiding Emission from Water Management Gray Infrastructure Construction and Operations Methodology v1.0_

**Developer:** Virridy

**Abstract:**

This _Methodology_ can be used by _Project Proponents_ to generate carbon credits by reducing nonpoint source contamination of watersheds, thereby avoiding the increased greenhouse gas emissions from the status-quo infrastructure construction and electricity use associated with industrial drinking water and wastewater management and treatment.

This methodology creates a standardized approach to quantify and verify the emission reduction benefits of green infrastructure projects that improve water quality. Project Proponents using this methodology will quantify the reduction in GHG emissions associated with avoided energy and material use from the upgrading or new construction of water quality treatment facilities.

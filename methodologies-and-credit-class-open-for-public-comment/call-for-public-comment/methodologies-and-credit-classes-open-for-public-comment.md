# Methodologies and Credit Classes Open for Public Comment

## **Currently Open for Public Comment**

**AEI has submitted "Regenerative Soil Organic Carbon Methodology**\
**for Rangeland, Grassland, Agricultural, and Conservation Lands**_**V2.0"**_**&#x20;for Public Comment.  Comments can be submitted through May 1, 2025**



The Regenerative Standard has been adopted by Developers on over one million acres as the standard to capture carbon sequestration through regenerative grassland grazing. Version 1.0 was designed to be an on-ramp for ranchers and farmers to gain familiarity with and contribute to global climate mitigation benefits, designed around a rolling 5 year contract period that pays annually for crediting, and requires a 10 yr monitoring tail. Version 1.0 will remain in place as approved to serve the large and growing user-base of acreages registered under this version.&#x20;

AEI now releases TRS V 2.0 is focused on accelerating the scale of use, lengthening the monitoring period to a minimum of 40 years post-crediting period, with 100 or in perpetuity options. V.2 expands the glossary of terms, provides additional tools to clarify for reviewers and users buffering, permanence risk assessments, monitoring, and the quantitative measure to measure crediting requirements, while helping encourage project developers and landowners to move to adopting the longer term monitoring commitments.  &#x20;

TRS 2.0 credits are enrolled by a project developer and managed through Natureâ€™s Registry. AEI maintains and stewards the TRS scientific protocols, while the separate and autonomous Registry maintains the business procedures, functions,  reporting and crediting and ledger records.

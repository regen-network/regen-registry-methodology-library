# Ecometric Updated Methodology Proposal for Soil Organic Carbon Estimation in Regenerative v 1.2.2



### Developer: [Ecometric](https://www.ecometric.co.uk/)

### Credit Type: Carbon

### Original Version with Document History:  [_Soil Organic Carbon Estimation in Regenerative Cropping & Managed Grassland Ecosystems v1.1_](https://registry.regen.network/v/methodology-library/published-methodologies/soil-organic-carbon-estimation-in-regenerative-cropping-and-managed-grassland-ecosystems)

## Summary of Methodology Update:

Update V1.2.2 of the ecometric Methodology for Soil Organic Carbon Estimation in Regenerative Cropping and Managed Grassland Ecosystems proposes the following changes:

* The inclusion of Loss on Ignition laboratory test in geographies where there is no regional availability of DUMAS testing.
* Using a sampling simulation based on the estimated SOC value range within a Project Area to calculate and report sampling uncertainty for a range of Compact Geographic Stratification strata sizes, for each monitoring round.   This tool will be used to balance sampling uncertainty with sampling cost on large project areas and to transparently report the uncertainty associated with the selected sampling density for verifiers and auditors.

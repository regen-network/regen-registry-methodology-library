# Watershed Nature-Based and Green Infrastructure Water Methodlogy and Watershed Credit Class

## Overview

**Methodology Name**: _Watershed Nature-Based and Green Infrastructure Activities Avoiding Emission from Water Management Gray Infrastructure Construction and Operations Methodology v1.0_

**Credit Class Name**_: GHG & Co-Benefits in Watershed Carbon v1.0_&#x20;

**Developer:** Virridy

**Sectoral Scope:**&#x20;

**Abstract:**

This Credit Class can be used by Project Proponents to generate carbon credits by reducing nonpoint source contamination of watersheds, thereby avoiding the increased greenhouse gas emissions from the status-quo infrastructure construction and electricity use  associated with industrial drinking water and wastewater management and treatment.&#x20;

While green water infrastructure is often more affordable than gray water infrastructure, it is not presently the preferred solution by most water treatment facilities because key decision-makers are structurally biased towards preferring technology, given that distributed, nature-based solutions have more variable benefits based on changing environmental conditions, and implementing green infrastructure generally involves the complexity of working with many private landowners.&#x20;

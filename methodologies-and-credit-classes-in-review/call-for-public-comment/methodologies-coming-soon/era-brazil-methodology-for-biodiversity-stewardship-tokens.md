# ERA Brazil Methodology for Biodiversity Stewardship Tokens

## Overview

> **Methodology Name**: Biodiversity Stewardship Tokens Methodology: Protocol for Ideation, Implementation & Monitoring
>
> **Developer:** ERA CARBON SERVIÇOS AMBIENTAIS LTDA.
>
> **Sectoral Scope:** Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use
>
> **Abstract:**
>
> The ERA Brazil Methodology for Biodiversity Stewardship Tokens (henceforth called the “Methodology”) provides a holistic assessment of ecological state indicators as well as practice-based indicators to incentivize the maintenance of conservation areas, crucial for the perennity and resilience of wildlife and biodiversity.
>
> This Methodology sets the basis for the continuous monitoring of Umbrella Species on a specific Project Time Frame, which, coupled with Environmental Stewardship indicators, creates a favorable net outcome for the chosen Umbrella Species (US) and the whole ecosystem under management.
>
> To apply this Methodology to a specific biodiversity conservation project, it is necessary to produce and submit evidence of the presence of the chosen Umbrella Species in the Property Area as demonstrated in the document US Guideline using jaguars as the example of the identified Umbrella species.
